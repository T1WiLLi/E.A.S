E.A.S (Easy Animation Scroll) Version 1.1 at 23/05/08

E.A.S is a free library of animations designed to be easily modifiable. It provides a set of pre-defined CSS classes and 
JavaScript functions to add animation effects to elements when they enter or leave the viewport. 
It is intended for all levels of web developers but mostly for beginners as it is less complex than A.O.S.


To use the library, you need to add the following script tag to your HTML file:

```html
<script src="path/to/eas.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/eas.css">
```

To initialize E.A.S, call the `init` method with the desired configuration options, as shown below:

```js
EAS.init({
    animationDuration: 2000,
    animationDelay: 500,
    animationEasing: 'ease-in-out',
    animationInfinite: false,
});
```

Alternatively, you can simply call `EAS.init()` to use the default configuration options.
