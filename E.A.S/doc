E.A.S (Easy Animation Scroll)

E.A.S is a free library of animations designed to be easily modifiable. It provides a set of pre-defined CSS classes and 
JavaScript functions to add animation effects to elements when they enter or leave the viewport. 
It is intended for all levels of web developers but mostly for beginners as it is less complex than A.O.S.


To use the library, you need to add the following script tag to your HTML file:

```html
<script src="path/to/eas.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/eas.css">
```

To initialize E.A.S, call the `init` method with the desired configuration options, as shown below:

```js
EAS.init({
    animationDuration: 2000,
    animationDelay: 500,
    animationEasing: 'ease-in-out',
    animationInfinite: false,
});
```

Alternatively, you can simply call `EAS.init()` to use the default configuration options.

Data Attributes

Here is a list of all data attributes that can be used with E.A.S and their respective definitions:

- `eas-animate` – This will add an animation to the element. By default, it will be a simple fade-in, but you can customize it using one of the following values:
    - `fade-in`
    - `fade-out`
    - `zoom`
    - `slide-left`
    - `slide-right`
    - `slide-top`
    - `slide-bottom`

Example usage: `eas-animate="fade-in"`

- `eas-duration` – This will set the animation duration for the element in milliseconds. By default, it is set to `1000ms`.

Example usage: `eas-duration="2000"`

- `eas-delay` – This will set the delay before the animation starts for the element in milliseconds. By default, it is set to `0ms`.

Example usage: `eas-delay="500"`

- `eas-easing` – This will affect how the transition will behave. You can customize it using one of the following values:
    - `none`
    - `ease`
    - `ease-in`
    - `ease-out`
    - `ease-in-out`

Example usage: `eas-easing="ease-in-out"`

- `eas-infinite` – This will either activate the infinite animation or not. By default, it is set to `false`.

Example usage: `eas-infinite="true"`
